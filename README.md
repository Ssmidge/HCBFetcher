# HCB Transaction Fetcher

## Description
This CLI tool allows you to fetch information about HCB organizations, I created it to allow me to monitor transactions in a Slack channel.

## Functionality
It can only monitor specific organizations for now, however more features are planned.

## Configuration
**The environment file is DEPRECATED. Use the YAML configuration instead!!**
